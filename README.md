Restaurant App
Overview

The Restaurant App is a comprehensive solution for managing restaurant operations, including viewing menus, placing orders, and handling reservations. It consists of a web application (Suing) for restaurant management and an Android mobile application for customer interaction. The system communicates with a PHP API, which interacts with the database to store and retrieve data.

Features

    Menu Viewing: Customers can browse the restaurant's menu and view details of dishes.
    Order Placement: Users can place orders directly from the Android app.
    Reservation Management: Restaurant staff can manage reservations and table assignments through the Suing web application.
    Communication with Database: The PHP API facilitates communication between the Suing app and the database, ensuring seamless data transfer.
